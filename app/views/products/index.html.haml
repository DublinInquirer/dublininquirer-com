        Dublin Inquirer is funded by its subscribers, rather than advertisers. That way, we can stay independent, and focused on the stories that readers want and need – and stories that you won’t find anywhere else.

        We also run occasional events, from pub quizzes to talks and debates. Subscribers often get first dibs on tickets, or discounts, or both.
