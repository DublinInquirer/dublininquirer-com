      # Contact us

      with tips, complaints, corrections, or compliments. You can always reach us by email at [info@dublininquirer.com](mailto:info@dublininquirer.com), but if you’re looking for something more secure – _although nothing is 100 percent_ – then, here are some other options.

      #### WhatsApp

      You can download the free messaging app onto your mobile phone to send and receive messages with full end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp does store some records, including phone numbers used in exchanges, users’ metadata and timestamps.

      Add us:

      `+353 873924796`

      #### Signal

      Similar to WhatsApp, Signal is also a free messaging app with full end-to-end encryption. Unlike WhatsApp, users can also opt to have their messages disappear after a certain length of time. You can download it from the iTunes app store.

      Add us:

      `+353 873924796`

      #### By Post

      You can also send us a letter:
