Hi <%= @given_name %>,

I just wanted to say thanks so much for supporting Dublin Inquirer with your generous monthly subscription. It's readers like you who make our work possible. You should receive your first issue in the post soon.

I really hope you enjoy reading the stories we tell each week, and if you've opted in to our newsletter then we'll keep you up-to-date with newsroom developments, and any offline activities through that, too.

We really think that our interests as journalists align better with readers' interests than with advertisers'. Readers, we figure, want quality, local, independent journalism that helps them understand and engage in and enjoy their city. We want to produce that.

So that's why we're trying to build a reader-supported news organisation. But that only works, of course, if people subscribe, so we're really grateful you did, as it helps us publish our online editions each week, and pay our staff and freelance journalists for their hard work, and work on extra projects like counciltracker.ie.

Please feel free to be in touch anytime. We're really eager to hear from our readers, whether its about ideas for things you'd like to see us writing about, or questions about what we're doing and why, or concerns about your subscription or anything.

You can reach us on this email, too or at 0873924796.

Best,
Lois Kapila
