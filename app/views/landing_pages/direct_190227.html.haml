              #### What does 'independent' and 'reader-funded' mean?

              _Independent_ means that the company is wholly owned by us. We don't need to answer to investors or shareholders who demand we maximise profitability or push a particular agenda.

              _Reader-funded_ means the _vast_ majority of our revenue comes from readers who subscribe. We think this aligns our incentives with those of our readers. If we're doomed to be beholden to our funders, we'd prefer those funders be Dubliners.

              #### Is there a student/unwaged rate?

              Nobody will be turned away for want of funds. If you're a student, not working, or otherwise unable to afford a subscription, send [us an email](mailto:brian@dublininquirer.com) and we'll see if we can work something out.

              #### What is the cancellation policy?

              You can cancel at any time. Your subscription will continue until the end of your billing cycle, and you won't be billed again. No long term contracts or funny business.
